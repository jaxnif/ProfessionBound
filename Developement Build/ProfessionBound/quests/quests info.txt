engineering progression:
first quest: RIght now (if you have not unlocked the other sectors) you can only make a molotov. Go ahead and do that now.
on completion: GG
2nd quest: In order to complete this quest you need to have unlocked sector b and tier 2 by defeating the first boss. Open up your engineering station and you will see that you have some new blueprints. We are going to make a chicken Coop. Notice that in order to do this you need some parts. Go ahead and make 1 copper screw and 1 copper gizmo gears, you will also need to have 3 steel bars on hand. Once you have those, make your chicke coop!
