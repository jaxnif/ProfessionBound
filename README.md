# _Profession Bound_

_This is the Profession Bound Developement Build. This may be incomplete and unstable, don't forget to make backups._

## Project Workflow

_How do I, as a developer, start working on the project?_ 

1. _All Pro-Bound team members can choose their own project for this mod, aswell as bring others into their own team to help them._
2. _Please make sure to check your changes before adding them to our developement build. If the game cannot load up due to your new content it should not yet be apart of the github commit._
3. _It's very important that you list all your changes made. You can add them directly to the drafted file in the news publishing section for team management. This is important to keep updated!_

## Become a Pro-Bound Team BETA Tester

_A beta tester is someone who tests a product before it is released. Product testers help companies identify weak points in their products that could cause consumer frustration, and they also identify specific issues that need to be corrected before a product can be released. Typically, these individuals test several incarnations of a product, until it is deemed ready for release._
