## Become a Pro-Bound Team BETA Tester

_A beta tester is someone who tests a product before it is released. Product testers help companies identify weak points in their products that could cause consumer frustration, and they also identify specific issues that need to be corrected before a product can be released. Typically, these individuals test several incarnations of a product, until it is deemed ready for release._
